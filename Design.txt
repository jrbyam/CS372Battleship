Design.txt
This is the basic design outline for the Battleship program to be created by James Lang and Jay Byam.

Outside World Sees:
Main Menu:
- Title logo
- Play button - leads to "Decide Players" scene
- Battleship-ish background

Decide Players Scene:
- Two options (buttons) - lead to "Player Setup" scene
  - One player (against computer) 
  - Two players (against each other)

Player Setup Scene:
- Defaults of "Player 1/2" and no pin
- If custom username is entered, pin must be provided
- Continue button - leads to "Game" scene

Game Scene:
- Two grids
  - "My" grid (smaller)
    - Shows ships (as placed by "me")
    - Shows "their" attempted shots (hits and misses)
    - Indicates for each ship if it is sunk (hit on all grid squares it takes up)
  - "Their" grid (bigger)
    - Shows "my" attempted shots (hits and misses)
    - Shows sunk ships (revealing what type they were)

Outside World Doesn't See:
- Ship class
  - int size (how many grid squares it will take up when placed)
  - List<GridSquare> gridSquares (which grid squares it takes up when placed)
  - bool sunk (set to true when all GridSquare's in gridSquares are hit)
- GridSquare class
  - int row
  - int column
  - bool hit (whether or not it's been fired at)
  - bool occupied (whether or not it has a ship on it)
- Game class
  - List<Ship> player1Ships
  - List<Ship> player2Ships
