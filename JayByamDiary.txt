Yesterday I confirmed with Dr. Chappell that using Unity is a viable option as we will be able to display and execute testing and game code in class.
With that, I created a base 2D Unity project and committed it to the repository that I made last week. It took me only 5 minutes or so; I already set up the
repo and had a Unity account in place.
After that I spent about 20 minutes writing out a few User Stories and assigning them respective difficulties. The hope is that we'll be able to extract
all the requirements we need from these.

Today we presented in class a few of our user stories and the basic overview of our project so far. I added a few more user stories after hearing proposed
features from other groups that I like but didn't think of myself.
