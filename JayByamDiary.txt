Yesterday I confirmed with Dr. Chappell that using Unity is a viable option as we will be able to display and execute testing and game code in class.
With that, I created a base 2D Unity project and committed it to the repository that I made last week. It took me only 5 minutes or so; I already set up the
repo and had a Unity account in place.
After that I spent about 20 minutes writing out a few User Stories and assigning them respective difficulties. The hope is that we'll be able to extract
all the requirements we need from these.

Today we presented in class a few of our user stories and the basic overview of our project so far. I added a few more user stories after hearing proposed
features from other groups that I like but didn't think of myself.

James and I met up in Arctic Java today with the intent of talking over and writing up our requirements document and our design document. We finished both
these goals after about an hour of me being there. We derived most of our requirements from the user stories we came up with last week. Those were very 
helpful in making sure we covered all the bases in our requirements. There was a bit more "winging it" with the design document. We just wrote out the flow
of play broken up into scenes and each scene's components. After covering the intended look of the game, we moved on to what we felt would be best under the
hood. We talked over what classes we should have, what members each class would need to include and what role each of these would play in the overall game.
With the design document all hashed out, we have a very clear direction in which to proceed in beginning to write the code. So far, I am very pleased with the
software development process as described in class. No complaints.
We also spent a few minutes of me showing James a few small things in Unity that I've picked up, just so we can be mostly on the same page in that department.

Today in class we did pair programming! We didn't really get very far, not having much time, so I haven't yet formed an opinion on PP. We did figure out which
of our requirements we'd like to achieve with TDD, and we are going to meet on Friday to continue pair prgramming. I should be able to form an opinion of PP by
then.
